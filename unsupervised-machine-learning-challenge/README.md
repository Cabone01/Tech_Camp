# Myopia
From a raw set a data, prepared the data for use for unsupervised machine learning. Once they were prepared I fit the models used a PCA and used n_components=0.9 as the explained variance. Afterwards I reduced the dimensions down to two using the output that I had gotten from my PCA model. From the scatter plot I made, I was able to see about five clusters on the model. Then from there I used an elbow plot to determine the best point of k on the model. I believe the the five clusters is where the elbow is at, and I determined that mdeical research company should cluster patients into five distinct groups.
