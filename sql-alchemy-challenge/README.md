# Climate
## Jupyter
At the start an engine was made for the sqlite file that was in the resources folder. Once the database was reflected a reference was made of each of the tables inside. This allowed me to begin the session to start quering. I first got the latest date which I used to make a query of the last 12 months of the date and precipitation from the measurement database. This was made into a dataframe and I converted the Date column into a datetime type so that it would better fit the graph. I then made a bar graph of that data which shows how much rain happened and saw that most of the time the rain rarely goes above 1 or 2 inches. Afterwards through another query I found the minimum, maximum, and average temperature of the most active station using the same database. Next I made a dataframe from a query of the last 12 months of only the TOBs to make a histogram. With this we can see that the tempature is most frequenctly around 70-80 which appears correct from our average of 71.67 that I found.
## App
Next I made a climate app that will has multiple api routes. For the precipitation route, a json of the date and preciptation is given from the databases. The stations route gives a json of station ids and station name. The tobs route gives a json of date and tob. The last two routes ask for a time range for both start and end depending on route which it will use to create a json of the minimum, maximum, and average temperature of the gven range.
